# Question A

To figure out if the two lines overlap, we first have to find the check the conditions and before that we have to understand the geometry behind that. To understand it better let us see the figure below:

               A------>B  C------->D  E------->F
            
                           Figure.1

As seen from figure 1, all these are x-axis lines and if you want to check that if they overlap we just have to see the end points and based on that we can say that if “AB” is touching or entering into “CD” or “DC” is touching or entering “EF” in either the condition we can say that the two lines overlap.

Based on the above observation we have designed the algorithm and all the possible test cases are given.


## Execution: 

•	Input (x1, x2), but separated by a space, similarly enter (x3, x4).

•	Code assigns a variable for both the lines and then sort them.

•	Depending on the condition it returns output.

•	Main code Calls the “whtroverlap” function to get the required output. Same can be established using the test cases.
